# OpenGuessr Assistant

**OpenGuessr Assistant** enhances your OpenGuessr experience by providing:

- An adjustable-radius circle around the correct location.
- Quick location info: continent, country, and region/state.
- Easy-to-use buttons and input field for controlling the circle radius.

## Installation

1. Install [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (or suitable alternative) in your browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).
2. Create a new userscript in the TamperMonkey dashboard.
3. Copy the contents of `assistant.user.js` into the editor.
4. Save and enable the script.
5. Visit [OpenGuessr](https://openguessr.com/) — the script’s buttons and radius input will appear automatically as long as your browser and the plugin are configured correctly.

## Usage

- **Show Answer Circle** → Opens a temporary map with a red circle showing the general area of the answer.
- **Radius Input** → Adjust the circle’s radius in kilometers before opening the map.
- **Show Continent / Show Country / Show Country + Region** → Popup messages display location info for the current round.

The popup map automatically closes after a set duration.
